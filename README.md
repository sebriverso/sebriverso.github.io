# Introduction and Objectives
Airline delays can be a major inconvenience for travelers, causing them to miss connections, arrive late to their destination, and disrupt their plans. Delays can occur due to a variety of factors, including weather, mechanical issues, and air traffic congestion. For frequent travelers, delays can be especially frustrating, as they can lead to lost productivity and increased stress.

To address this issue, we are creating a machine learning model to predict if a given flight would have a delay and if so, approximately how long that delay would be. By analyzing historical data on flight patterns and delays, the model will be able to identify patterns and make predictions about the likelihood and length of delays for future flights. This information will allow travelers to preemptive measures to their travel and plans. This will also allow airlines to proactively take steps to prevent delays, such as adjusting flight schedules or making maintenance repairs before issues arise. Ultimately, this will help improve the experience for travelers and help airliners better prepare for future delays.
